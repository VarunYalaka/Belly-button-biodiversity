## Overview of Project

Roza is a biological researcher in a prominent microbiology laboratory. Many bacterial species are not well studied and many more remain unknown to science. Roza likes to discover and document these bacteria. In particular she is interested in bacterial species that have the ability to synthesize protein that tastes like beef. Roza has a hypothesis that there’s a microorganism that can supply the next best taste and that’s found in the belly button.  Roza wants to create a dashboard with research participants with the subject id number and Demographic info.

* Java script

* HTML 

* CSS

* Plotly 

* D3.js
